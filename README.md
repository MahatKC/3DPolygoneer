Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@spalshzzz](https://github.com/spalshzzz) and [@robertaalcantara](https://github.com/robertaalcantara) in 2021.

This project was an assignment for the Computer Graphics class we took in our 3rd year of Computer Science.

Developed in Python with NumPy and Tkinter, it renders polyhedra according to user input, allowing multiple polyhedra to be rendered in a single scene, each one of them capable of being moved, rotated or scaled.
